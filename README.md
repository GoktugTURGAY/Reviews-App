This component is built with React.js & TailwindCSS. 

The data regarding the reviews is stored in a remote JSON server via json-server npm package that provides crude back-end functionality:
npm i json-server
Then the data is fetched via FETCH API.

Dynamic functionality is given as you can post or remove reviews from the app, authenticate inputs as well as a spinner put in place during data fetching.
